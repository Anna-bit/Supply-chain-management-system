# Build a complete supply chain management system using mysql and powerBI. 

• Wrote SQL queries using views to check order performance, supplier performance, and raw material distribution among other metrics.
• Connected SQL queries to Power BI to develop dynamic dashboards and KPI visualizations.
• Created interactive reports for order fulfillment rate, supplier scorecards, and raw materials stock-out alerts.

This Power BI & SQL project delivers a comprehensive analysis of a global supply chain system, offering end-to-end visibility into supplier performance, raw material distribution, transportation routes, and cost metrics. The interactive dashboard tracks 47 total orders involving 13 raw materials and evaluates the contributions of 10 suppliers across key global regions including East Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Americas.

* Key insights include:
•	East Asia Plastics and India Textiles Co. are top suppliers by order volume.
•	Recycled Plastic and Scrap metal are the most supplied raw materials.
•	Sea routes dominate logistics, accounting for 72% of supplier transport which impacts the lead time.
•	Supplier performance is further evaluated through metrics like average lead time.
•	Raw materials are evaluated based on their unit price and trigger status, which is activated once the reorder level is reached.
•	The highest lead times were observed for suppliers in the region of Asia, likely due to their regional concentration.

The report highlights raw materials with triggered pricing conditions, assisting procurement in cost control and vendor evaluation.
This analysis supports data-driven supply chain optimization by identifying sourcing efficiencies, cost drivers, and regional supplier strengths.

**Tools Used: ** Power BI, DAX, Excel, SQL
Impact: Helped stakeholders pinpoint cost inefficiencies, optimize vendor selection, and improve supply chain responsiveness through data-driven insights.
